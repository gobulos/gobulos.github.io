    <p>
fast guy plays quite the important role on the team, as the roamer. He watches the flank so other classes don't have to.
He can still participate in team fights, it's just that he primarily watches the flank
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
the fast guy has a couple key components that make him strong in certain situations, some being that he is the fastest character 
in the whole game, at 50 walkspeed, he can outpace the whole roster.
